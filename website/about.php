  <h2>About Baby Name Match</h2>
  <p>Have someone (human, cat, iguana, we don't judge) coming into your life that needs a name? 
     This website is designed to allow users to pair with one another
     to find names that they both love. Sign up with as many partners or friends as you like, 
     then start picking the names that speak to you. 'My Matches!' will update you 
     whenever you and your partner both like the same name. Happy name matching!</p>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>
   <p>The set of names that are used on this site are drawn from
      the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html"> US Social Security database</a>.
      That means that any name that was given to at least 5 newborns in a year since 1880
      is inside the database (somewhere, there are a lot of dusty corners around
      here). </p>

  <h2>About Privacy</h2>
  <p>While we're still working out an <a href='privacy.php'>official policy</a>
     The short version is: we will never sell your data, and we will never share
     your email address or name with anyone, ever. We will be analyzing your usage 
     of the site to try and make it better, and to see if we can learn anything cool 
     about how people pick baby names. To that end, we may also share anonymized selection 
     and partnering data with other organizations. Any data shared will always be anonymized.
     You can delete your  account at any time, at which point any identifiable data about you 
     will be deleted. We will also delete your partner data and selection data from our servers, 
     but your anonymized data will remain part of any datasets we have shared (as we no longer
     control it, we cannot guarantee deletion). You can request a copy of all data we have stored 
     about you at any time. </p>

  <h2>WaldoCorp</h2>
  <p> Baby Name Match is hosted as a service of WaldoCorp, which is just
     a fancy way of saying that <a href='mailto:ben@waldocorp.com'>Ben</a>
     and <a href='mailto:lief@waldocorp.com'>Lief</a> made it and we hope
     that it is useful for you. 
 
     WaldoCorp is not (yet) a registered corporation, but its the name Ben and Lief picked  
     as an umbrella for various projects. 
     Its named for Waldo, an adorable cat who started life in a college dorm room, 
     and now is the Queen of Ben's apartment. Baby Name Match is our first product, and we
     hope to create more cool things in the future.</p>
