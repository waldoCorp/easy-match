  <h2>About Baby Name Match</h2>
  <p>This website is designed to allow users to pair with one another
     to find names that they both find palatable for any potential young
     individuals in their lives (or cats, fish, iguanas, or whatever - we're
     not here to judge). It is hosted as a service of WaldoCorp, which is just
     a fancy way of saying the Ben and Lief made it and they hope that it is
     useful for you. </p>

  <h3>Using Name Match </h3>

    <li> You can always change your mind about a name on 'My Names'  </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>About the Data</h3>
   <p>The set of names that are used on this site are drawn from
      the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html"> US Social Security database</a> . That means that any name that was given
      to at least 5 newborns in a year since 1880
      is inside the database (somewhere, there are a lot of dusty corners around
      here). </p>

   <h2>WaldoCorp</h2>
   <p> WaldoCorp is not (yet) a real corporation, but its the name Ben and Lief picked  
       as an umbrella for various projects. 
       Its named for Waldo, an adorable cat who started life in a college dorm room, 
       and now is the Queen of Ben's apartment. Baby Name Match is our first product, and we
       hope to create more cool things in the future.</p>

   <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
   <p> We will never sell your data. We will never share your email address. We may share reports
       on interesting (or boring) things we find in the data, such reports will be presented in aggregate 
       form and will not identify individuals. We may share the anonymized data on name selections and 
       partner matches with other people who are interested in it. </p>
