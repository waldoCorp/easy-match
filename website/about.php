  <h2>About Baby Name Match</h2>
  <p>This website is designed to allow users to pair with one another
     to find names that they both find palatable for any potential young
     individuals in their lives (or cats, fish, iguanas, or whatever -- we're
     not here to judge). It is hosted as a service of WaldoCorp, which is just
     a fancy way of saying the Ben and Lief made it and they hope that it is
     useful for you. </p>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>
   <p>The set of names that are used on this site are drawn from
      the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html"> US Social Security database</a> . That means that any name that was given
      to at least 5 newborns in a given year since 1880
      is inside the database (somewhere, there are a lot of dusty corners around
      here). </p>
