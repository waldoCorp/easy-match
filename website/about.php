  <h2>About Baby Name Match</h2>
  <p>This website is designed to allow users to pair with one another
     to find names that they both find palatable for any potential young
     individuals in their lives (or cats, fish, iguanas, or whatever - we're
     not here to judge). It is hosted as a service of WaldoCorp, which is just
     a fancy way of saying that <a href='mailto:ben@waldocorp.com'>Ben</a>
     and <a href='mailto:lief@waldocorp.com'>Lief</a> made it and they hope
     that it is useful for you. </p>

  <h2>About the Data</h2>
  <p>The set of names that are used on this site are drawn from ~150 years of
     the US Social Security database. That means that any name that was given
     to at least 5 newborns in a given year in the last century and a half
     is inside the database (somewhere, there are a lot of dusty corners around
     here). By default, we will only show you names that have been relatively
     popular within the last 20 years but you are more than welcome to adjust
     the filtering options to your liking. </p>

  <h2>About Privacy</h2>
  <p>While we're still working out an <a href='privacy.php'>official policy</a>
     The short version is: We will not sell any personal data that could
     be used to identify you. Internal statistics and any data given or sold
     to a third party will always use anonymized data. You can delete your
     account at any time, at which point all data we store about you
     will be deleted. Note that aggregated data given to an external party
     in the past might still contain your anonymous data (as we no longer
     control it). </p>
