  <h2>WaldoCorp Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p> Ben and Lief like making things, and now we’re sharing them with you.
      Our first product, Easy Match, helps you find names that you, and your partners, love.
      To do that, we store the minimum amount of data necessary to make the website run.
      This privacy policy was updated on December 27, 2019 </p>

  <h3> How We Collect Your data </h3>
  <p>  All the data we collect is explicitly provided by you when you fill out the sign up form,
       choose names you like, invite friends to partner with, or fill out a survey.
       We also log the time at which these events occur. </p>

  <h3> What Data We Collect </h3>
  <ul>
     <li> When you sign up we will ask for your email address and a user name. We require a working
       email address to use our site. This allows you to set and reset your password, and to partner
        with other users. It allows us to communicate with you about your account. </li>
     <li> Your password: we never store the plaintext of your password, our server only stores your
          password when its salted and hashed. This lets us manage account log ins. In the event of
          a data breach, the plaintext of your password will not be leaked because we don’t have it.  </li>
     <li> Names you like and don’t like: this is the core functionality of our site, we keep track
          of your name ratings so we can show you name matches and so we can improve our product.  </li>
     <li> Your partners: We store the email addresses of the people you’d like to compare name
          matches with and whether they accepted your partnership request.  </li>
     <li> We may conduct surveys of our users to better understand our user base and improve our
          product. Such surveys will be strictly opt-in and use of our site will never require your
          participation.  </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> What We Can Do With Your Data </h3>
  <p> We will never share any email addresses or user names except as required by law (see <b>Legal Requests for Data</b>).
      We reserve the right to share anonymized data of name ratings and partnerships. We may share
      this anonymized data to improve our product or to further academic research into matching
      behavior or baby naming trends. While the data we may share will be fully anonymized, it is
      possible that other entities can correlate the data we release with other available data.
      If you are rating names on other web services, or other information about names you like are
      publicly available, there is a risk that your records could be re-identified. This is not a
      likely outcome, and the terms of use for any partners we may share the data with require that
      they explicitly agree that they will not attempt to de-anonymize the data. You can opt-out of this
      data sharing at any time on the <a href='account.php'> account page</a>. </p>

  <h3> Data Retention </h3>
  <p> We will retain your data indefinitely, unless you decide to delete your account. If you
      delete your account, we will immediately remove all of your data from our servers. </p>

  <h3> View And Delete Your Data </h3>
  <p> You can view and download all data we have stored about you at any time.
      You can also delete your account and all data associated with from our servers at any time.
      These actions can be taken on the <a href='account.php'> account page</a>.
      Please note, if we have shared your anonymized data with third parties
      we will not be able to delete that anonymized data, however your data will not be part of
      any future anonymized datasets that may be shared. We do not support data
      transfer to or from any other websites. </p>

  <h3> California Do Not Track Disclosure </h3>
  <p> We do not acknowledge your browsers do not track setting. See the <b>Cookies</b> section for more information </p>

  <h3> Cookies and Tracking </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> We use a session cookie to store your log in credentials. This cookie is only used to enable your access to this website.  </li>
    <li> We track your logged in use of our site across sessions. We do not track any use of our site while you are not logged in.</li>
    <li> We do not use any third party analytics, we do all of our site analytics ourselves. </li>
    <li> We do not use any tracking beacons.</li>
    <li> We do not track you across third party websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Legal Requests For Data </h3>
  <p> If served with a lawful warrant for user data we will comply and turn over all requested data.  </p>

  <h3> Automated Decision Making and Machine Learning </h3>
  <p> Our site currently randomly selects names to show you based on the filters you apply, the names
      your partners like, and simple popularity rules. In the future we intend to improve our site by
      implementing a recommendation engine that will analyze your name selections to show you names
      that you are more likely to approve and are more likely to lead to matches with your partners.
      Such a system does not yet exist. When and if it is implemented, it will be used to improve user
      experience on the site. </p>
  </p>

  <h3> International Data Use </h3>
  <p> Our servers are located in the U.S.A.  All data is stored locally on servers under Ben’s physical control. </p>

  <h3> Children's Data </h3>
  <p> waldoCorp is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
      children under the age of 13. If we find out that a child under the age of 13 has signed up with
       us, we will delete their account and data. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has
       given us personal information, please contact us. </p>

  <h3> Contact Us </h3>
  <p> Lief is our designated Data Protection Officer. If you have any questions about our privacy policy
  or our handling of you data, please <a href='mailto:privacy@waldocorp.com'>contact him</a>.  </p>
