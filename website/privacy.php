  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>While we are working on a privacy policy, the abbreviated things to know
     are: By using this site, you agree to allow us to store a session cookie
     on your local computer. This is not for tracking purposes beyond ensuring
     users are logged in. We will not sell your (personalized) data, your
     browsing habits, anything about names you may have liked or disliked,
     who you might be partnered with, your email address, or really anything
     else personal about you that we might know. We might do statistics on
     aggregated and anonymized data since we're both of an academic sort, but
     we will endeavor to be responsible users of this aggregate data.
     Similarly, we might share anonymized data with a third party, but not in
     a way that allows that data to be linked to you as a person. You are able
     to delete your account at any time, at which point everything we have
     stored about you will also be deleted. Note that this will not delete
     data that has been externally shared (as we no longer control it), but
     it will always be anonymous by that point. </p>
